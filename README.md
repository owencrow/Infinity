# Infinity

This is the DemoReel100.ino from the FastLED library tweaked to work on the specific infinity mirror and using an Arduino Mega.

There are 53 LEDs in the mirror. It uses Analog zero (A0) as digital input 54.

I'd mess with gPatterns to eliminate boring patters, and BRIGHTNESS to make it deeper (brighter) or shallower.
